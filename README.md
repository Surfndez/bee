## Automate your development and release process

bee is an open source platform aimed to simplify and standardize automation and deployment.
bee lets you automate every aspect of your development and release workflow.
bee runs everywhere - "it's just bash"

*__Automate the entire process from building your Unity project to uploading it to the app store__*

Combine bee with continuous integration tools such as [jenkins](https://jenkins.io), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) or [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) to automatically
build and distribute your applications.


## Extending with Plugins

bee comes with a set of builtin plugins like 
`changelog`, `dotnet`, `doxygen`, `git`, `github`, `ios`, `unity`, `version`, and more...

Plugins allow you to customize and personalize bee to fit any requirement.
