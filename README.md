## Automate your development and release process

bee is an open source platform aimed to simplify and standardize automation and deployment.
bee lets you automate every aspect of your development and release workflow.
bee runs everywhere - "it's just bash"

*__Automate the entire process from building your project to uploading it to the app stores__*

Combine bee with continuous integration tools such as [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) or [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) to automatically
build and distribute your applications.

## Extending with Plugins

bee is as a plugin launcher with package management functionality.
Plugins are registered at beehub which is the official bee plugin register: https://github.com/sschmid/beehub

You can register your own plugin at beehub by creating a pull request.
You can also create your own custom register or local plugins for your personal or private use.

Plugins allow you to customize and personalize bee to fit any requirement.
Are you missing a task or feature? Create your own plugins and contribute to beehub!
Share your plugins with the bee community so everyone can start saving time today.

Plugins and commands can easily be discovered with bee's built-in auto-completion! (see [wiki](https://github.com/sschmid/bee/wiki/bee-bash-completion))
